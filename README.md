_This plugin was created using `skpm`. For a detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [skpm Readme](https://github.com/skpm/skpm/blob/master/README.md)._

Labelizer will retrieve labels from your sketch file, you will then be able to modify them and replace the existing one.

You can export or import your labels as .json or .csv files.
